# PHP CMS 

## Our project
For the final assignment for PHP we have to make individuel or in a team
a cms. We have chosen to work in a team and our team consists of:
Jacob, Nabil, Uday, Luc and Milou. This assignment contains a number of components that must be included, just like: 
- A sign-up/login procedure for different types of users (Milou)
- Roles and rights for different types of users          (Uday)
- Content management                                     (Jacob)
- Dashboard                                              (Jacob)
- Asset management                                       (Nabil)
- Information page                                       (Luc)

## What is a cms?
Cms stands for contentmanagmentsystem what mostly is used for webapplication. This allows people to easily post documents and data
on the internet without technical knowledge. 

## What have we done for now?
We have made an information page what linked to the sign-up/login page.
If you are going to sign-up your:
- name
- email 
- password <br>
will appear in the database. Your password will also be hashed.
If you have forgotten your password, you can go to the form "Wachtwoord vergeten"
and change your password there. This will also be updated in the database.
When you log in as admin, you will be sent to the cms.
When you log in as user, you will be sent to the information page.
Apart from that we have finished the roles and rights.

## To do
We still need to work on Asset Management and Dashboard.
